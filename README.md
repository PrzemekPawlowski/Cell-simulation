Cell simulation. The program was created using the C ++ language and the Builder C ++ environment.
The program carries out a cell simulation based on the data entered by the user. As parameters, we set the number of cells, the time with which the simulation is to be displayed, and the parameters defining the life of a single cell. A few screenshots of the program's operation.
