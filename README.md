## General info
Cell simulation. The program was created using the C ++ language and the Builder C ++ environment.
The program carries out a cell simulation based on the data entered by the user.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* C ++ programming language
* Development environment: C ++ Builder 6
	
## About the application
As parameters, we set the number of cells, the time with which the simulation is to be displayed, and the parameters defining the life of a single cell. To run the application, just run Project1.exe from the Cell Simulation file.
A few screenshots of the program's operation.

During the simulation on the board, we can observe how the cells behave.

When the cells can no longer duplicate, the program ends the simulation and returns information about the simulation performed.
