## General info
Cell simulation. The program was created using the C ++ language and the Builder C ++ environment.
The program carries out a cell simulation based on the data entered by the user.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* C ++ programming language
* Development environment: C ++ Builder 6
	
## About the application
As parameters, we set the number of cells, the time with which the simulation is to be displayed, and the parameters defining the life of a single cell. To run the application, just run Project1.exe from the Cell Simulation file.
A few screenshots of the program's operation.

###During the simulation on the board, we can observe how the cells behave.

###When the cells can no longer duplicate, the program ends the simulation and returns information about the simulation performed.
